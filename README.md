# New Haven City Transformation Plan dashboard v1

This repository houses a [draft](https://ct-data-haven.github.io/ctp-dash/) of the New Haven City Transformation Plan (CTP) dashboard built by [DataHaven](http://ctdatahaven.org).

## About the dashboard

The City of New Haven, in partnership with DataHaven, is piloting an online dashboard that makes tracking progress on key indicators of well-being and program performance easy and transparent. It contains a front page with an overview of indicators, and individual pages for each of the four preliminary CTP sectors---Early Childhood, Health, Housing, Workforce---as well as a set of cross-sector measures.

## About the CTP

The City Transformation Plan is a guide for citywide improvement of New Haven communities across 8 sectors. Organizations involved in the CTP effort, as well as city government, will be tracking progress of indicators for each of these sectors at both population and programmatic levels. Read the plan at http://www.transformnewhaven.org/.
